**Assessment Information**  
The assessment contains two practicals (15% each), and a team project with two people (70%).  

Practical 1 Submission (15%)  
  - Deadline (5th Feb, submission on BlackBoard): A Markdown file: with all answers (plots, tables …) of the questions and optional questions in Lab 1 and Lab2. The file should be named as practical1_your_college_short_code.md (eg. practical1_yz10513.md).
  - Corresponding code in your forked repository (will be checked in the lab oral, no submission needed). But you can include code snippets in the submitted markdown file.
  - Deadline (TBC, but around 5th Feb) Lab Oral.

Practical 2 Submission (15%)  
  - Deadline (5th Feb, submission on BlackBoard): A Markdown file: with all answers (plots, tables …) of the questions and optional questions in Lab 3 and Lab4. The file should be named as practical2_your_college_short_code.md (eg. practical2_yz10513.md).
  - Corresponding code in your forked repository (will be checked in the lab oral, no submission needed). But you can include code snippets in the submitted markdown file.
  - Deadline (TBC, but around 5th Feb) Lab Oral.

Team Project (70%)  
  - A roadmap meeting with a GTA (not assessed).
  - Deadline (18th March): A show me your code lab oral (assessed).
  - Deadline (28th March): Coursework code submission as a pull request on Github (assessed). The PR should also have a clear documentation of the functionality that you have implemented and its corresponding tests. The tests should be integrated into the existing testing framework.
  - Deadline (28th March, PDF attached in the PR): 8-page Report (assessed). The report should mainly focus on an evaluation of your implementation. The description of functionality and testing has being described in the PR already, so this 8-page report should include the experiments you have designed to explore certain trade-offs and properties of your optimization.
